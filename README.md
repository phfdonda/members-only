# Members Only!

## Description

This app is a Rails project for the Microverse's RoR curriculum, following TOP curriculum for webdevelopment. We have practiced the new knowledge about simple forms, Devise usage for authentication and much more.

## About the project

Are you a veteran gossiper? Do you want to talk about other people without repercussions? You do, don't you, you naughty? So become a member now! Only members can see what other members have said, so talk dirt about anyone else - as long as they are not members!

## Authorization

This project used Devise to require a registration in order to see the author of any post. What would be the fun of making someone miserable if they can't hear what is being said about them, right? (Disclaimer: We're not endorsing bullying, this is irony - we know it can be lost in written words =P) The app will track the session's authentication, so it will know if the user is a member or not, showing the text to everyone, but the authorship only for members.
